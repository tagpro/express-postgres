### Running on Docker

# Pre install 
Make sure you check up on docker-compose settings before setting it up. Also install docker and docker-compose. Follow docker's official website and not some 3rd party site. They are all crazy.

1. `npm install`
2. `docker-compose up`
3. Go to `localhost:8080/api/v1/users` on your browser

## Debugging
Open VS code and connect to the docker's env to debug directly via VS Code. Attach to Docker via the debug view in VS Code.
